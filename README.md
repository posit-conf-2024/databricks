## Description

As most organization’s data migrate to the cloud, the ability to analyze
data in-place becomes more important. This workshop will walk you
through how to think about remote data, how to access it, and how to
analyze it efficiently. We will review the latest in integrations

During the workshop, we will discuss best practices for when to use
which integration, as well as techniques to take your analysis into
production.
